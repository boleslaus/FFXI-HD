NOTE: I have only tested this for use with Ashita3 and Windower4
 - Retail users will likely need to follow the instructions below but instead point to POL.EXE found in \Program Files (x86)\PlayOnline\SquareEnix\PlayOnlineViewer
 - Windower users will likely need to follow the instructions below but instead point to xiloader.exe or the original POL.exe

-------------
Ashita3
-------------
1) Install and configure Ashita3
2) Run ReShade_Setup_3.1.0.exe found in this Mod Pack ---> If your Antivirus flags this file, IT IS SAFE TO RUN. Disable your Antivirus Shields, if necessary.
   You can also download and install ReShade directly from https://reshade.me if you prefer.
3) Point ReShade to POL.EXE found in \Ashita\ffxi-bootmod
4) Select Direct3D 9. If prompted to download default shaders, please do so!
5) When complete, you may close ReShade Setup.
6) Copy d3d8.dll and FFXI - ReShade Preset.ini to your \Ashita\ffxi-bootmod folder
7) Launch Ashita3 and play! When prompted to configure ReShade, be sure to select the FFXI - ReShade Preset.

**To configure ReShade from within FFXI, press SHIFT+F2 to open the configuration menu. I would also recommend binding something like SHIFT+F12
  from within the configuration tool to enable or disable the plugin**

NOTE: Sometimes opening and closing the ReShade menu from within FFXI can bork your controller. To fix this, simply click outside of the FFXI window or ALT-TAB
      to something else and then back to FFXI.
