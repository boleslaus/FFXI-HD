Ru'Aun Gardens HQ Texture Overhaul - By Amelila

This pack has been included separate from the other mods because of the important notice below.

******************
IMPORTANT
******************

!!YOU MUST INSTALL THIS MOD TO YOUR FFXI INSTALL DIRECTORY!!

This particular zone consists of many separate DAT files that are loaded on demand, depending on
where you are in the zone. If you use the Ashita3 DAT Loader, certain pieces of the zone will
NOT load correctly.

The original DAT files are included with this Mod, should you want to revert back to the original zone.

======================
Installation
======================
[Optional] This HQ texture pack is best viewed with my ReShade preset. See the optional instructions towards the bottom to learn how to configure ReShade for FFXI.

1) Navigate to your FFXI ROM2 directory. This is typically \Program Files (x86)\PlayOnline\SquareEnix\FINAL FANTASY XI\ROM2\

2) Copy the 3 folders (12, 21, 22) directly into your ROM2 directory. Overwrite the existing files as necessary.

3) Enjoy Ru'Aun Gardens with HQ textures for the first time!


======================
OPTIONAL: ReShade
======================

NOTE: Retail users will likely need to follow the instructions below but instead point to POL.EXE found in \Program Files (x86)\PlayOnline\SquareEnix\PlayOnlineViewer

-------------
Ashita3
-------------
1) Install and configure Ashita3
2) Run ReShade_Setup_3.1.2.exe found in this Mod Pack ---> If your Antivirus flags this file, IT IS SAFE TO RUN. Disable your Antivirus Shields, if necessary.
   You can also download and install ReShade directly from https://reshade.me if you prefer.
3) Point ReShade to POL.EXE found in \Ashita\ffxi-bootmod
4) Select Direct3D 9. If prompted to download default shaders, please do so!
5) When complete, you may close ReShade Setup.
6) Copy d3d8.dll, "FFXI - ReShade Preset.ini" and "FFXI - Beautiful Lens FX.ini"
   to your \Ashita\ffxi-bootmod folder
7) Launch Ashita3 and play! When prompted to configure ReShade, be sure to select one of the 
   FFXI - ReShade Presets.

**To configure ReShade from within FFXI, press SHIFT+F2 to open the configuration menu. I would also recommend binding something like SHIFT+F12
  from within the configuration tool to enable or disable the plugin**

NOTE: Sometimes opening and closing the ReShade menu from within FFXI can bork your controller. To fix this, simply click outside of the FFXI window or ALT-TAB
      to something else and then back to FFXI.

Windower4
----------
Windower4 is also compatible with ReShade. Follow the exact same steps above, but point ReShade to xiloader.exe found within the Windower4 installation directory.
