Hd ffxi textures

In the zip files are the modded files and the originals so they can be changed back
and fourth easily, either manually copy the dats over one by one or drag the "ROM" 
folder from the mod zip to the "FINAL FANTASY XI" on your hard drive. 

Click yes on the confirmation prompts to overwrite the specific files 
(it won't do anything but overwrite the specified files in the folders).

The files included are weaponskill dats that change Gekko for each race and 
1 extra for each race that has another sex with different animations 
(hume/elvaan m and f) and one for Ark Angel Galka.
