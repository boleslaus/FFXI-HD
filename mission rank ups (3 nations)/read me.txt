In the zip files are the modded files and the originals so they can be changed back
and fourth easily, either manually copy the dats over one by one or drag the "ROM" 
folder from the mod zip to the "FINAL FANTASY XI" on your hard drive. 

Click yes on the confirmation prompts to overwrite the specific files 
(it won't do anything but overwrite the specified files in the folders).

15 dats for each nations, rank 1 > 10 and the 5 unused ranks 
(in-case they ever add the others)
