Hd ffxi textures

In the zip files are the modded files and the originals so they can be changed back
and fourth easily, either manually copy the dats over one by one or drag the "ROM" 
folder from the mod zip to the "FINAL FANTASY XI" folder on your hard drive. 

Click yes on the confirmation prompts to overwrite the specific files 
(it won't do anything but overwrite the specified files in the folders).

Large number of files in this zip is because 
a) each race and sometimes sex is a seperate dat due to animation differences.
b) weapons that can be dual wielded need seperate dats for offhand due to 
animation differences.
So for instance Colada weapon alone = 14 dats.
