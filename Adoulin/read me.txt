Hd ffxi textures

In the zip files are the modded files and the originals so they can be changed back
and fourth easily, either manually copy the dats over one by one or drag the "ROM" 
folder from the mod zip to the "FINAL FANTASY XI" on your hard drive. 

Click yes on the confirmation prompts to overwrite the specific files 
(it won't do anything but overwrite the specified files in the folders).

This dat is unfinished, I don't have access to the 2nd area yet so I can't properly change those
textures.  First area is more or less finished.  When I unlock the larger beach area I'll update.
